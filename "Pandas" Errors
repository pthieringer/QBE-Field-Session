## Errors related to unhappy "pandas" package

## From what I can tell from looking at those who were reporting problems with this part of the installation...it looks like you all
installed the wrong version of python. From those who sent me screenshots, if you look carefully it will show you that you installed
a more recent version of python (i.e. python3.10). For some reason, pandas is not happy with the newer versions of python and cannot
be installed with pip.
We need the older version. So this may actually be a simpler fix, but just a little bit of work.

## 1) Delete your conda environment (sorry!)

conda env remove -n anvio-7.1

## 1) Remake a new conda environment

conda create -y -n anvio-7.1

## 2) Install the CORRECT verion of python! Remember to activate your environment first

conda activate anvio-7.1

conda install python=3.6

## A note: make sure there are no spaces in between the "python=3.6" portion of the command

## 3) Follow the remainder of the Anvio installation instructions! Install the long list of packages. If you already ran the 
step to pull the "anvio-7.1.tar.gz" file you can just skip to running the pip installation. To check, run:

ls

## If this shows the "anvio-7.1.tar.gz" then just run the pip installation:

pip3 install anvio-7.1.tar.gz
